# The Spirit of Rockline

This ebook contains my personal history with the radio shows _Rockline_ and
_Modern Rock Live_, along with lists of past guests.

The lists are current as of the date given on the title page. If you have
any corrections for the guest lists, please add an issue in this repo.

## How to build the documents

The text is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
The ebook is built with the document converter [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org),
and is output in the epub and HTML formats. The file `build.bat` can be run in
a Windows command prompt, and will build both documents in the subfolder `build`.
