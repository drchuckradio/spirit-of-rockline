= The Spirit of Rockline

This ebook contains my personal history with the radio shows _Rockline_
and _Modern Rock Live_, along with lists of past guests.

== How to build the documents

The text is written in
https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown].
The ebook is built with the document converter
https://pandoc.org[Pandoc],
and is output in the epub and HTML formats. The file `build.bat`
can be run in a Windows command prompt, and will build both documents
in the subfolder `build`.
