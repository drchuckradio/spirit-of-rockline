# Guest Data and Contributions

The data for the guest lists has been compiled from multiple sources.
These include:

* Data from the former Rockline/Modern Rock Live area on America Online (AOL).
* Archived versions of the official Rockline website at the Internet Archive^[<<https://archive.org>>].
* Internet search results, including AllMusic^[<<https://www.allmusic.com>>] and Discogs^[<<https://www.discogs.com>>].

Over the years, there have been many outside contributors, and I apologize if
I don't name you all individually, but all you have done is greatly appreciated
and remembered.

Any further contributions or corrections to be made to these lists can be
provided via the GitHub repository^[<<https://github.com/drchuckradio/spirit-of-rockline>>].
